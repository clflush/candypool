How to install:

A) Database
1. Setup a mysql database and import the pool.sql file.
Make sure you are creating a innodb database.
Create a user for the poolserver to access this database.

Create a user in the table users with the id "1".
This is needed because all connecting workers will be assigned to this user.

B) Poolserver
1. Installing the required dependencies ( Ubuntu )

sudo apt-get install -y build-essential m4 libssl-dev libdb++-dev libboost-all-dev libminiupnpc-dev libmysql++-dev libmysqlclient-dev

Now you need to setup gmp with the following commands:
cd
rm -rf gmp-5.1.2.tar.bz2 gmp-5.1.2
wget http://mirrors.kernel.org/gnu/gmp/gmp-5.1.2.tar.bz2
tar xjvf gmp-5.1.2.tar.bz2
cd gmp-5.1.2
./configure --enable-cxx
make
sudo make install

Important:
Because encrypting the wallet is important you are supposed to change the wallet key in the source code.
The wallet key is hardcoded because it is more secure than to store it in a config file.
Open the file "main.cpp" and search for:

"pwallet->EncryptWallet("CHANGEME");"
Change "CHANGEME" to the wallet passphrase of your choice.
Do the same with:
pwallet->Unlock("CHANGEME");

As you now have all dependencies you can compile the poolserver itself:
Go into the sourcecode folder and type
make
strip primecoind

Copy the file primecoind into the home directory of the user you plan to run it with.
For example:
cp primecoind /home/pool/

If everything compiles without errors you need to create a configfile for the server.
The configfile must be in the ".primecoin" directory of the user running the poolserver.

Create a new system user called pool. After that enter the following commands:

su pool
cd
mkdir -p .primecoin
echo 'server=1
gen=1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcuser=primecoinrpc
rpcpassword=SOME_SECURE_PASSWORD
poolport=10034
sqlhost=localhost
sqluser=pool
sqldatabase=pool
sqlpassword=CHANGEMEBYHAND' > .primecoin/primecoin.conf
sed -i -e "s/SOME_SECURE_PASSWORD/`< /dev/urandom tr -cd '[:alnum:]' | head -c32`/" .primecoin/primecoin.conf

Make sure to replace the sql credentials in the .primecoin.conf file with the correct ones. 

Starting the poolserver:
cd 
chmod 770 primecoind
./primecoind

Now try to connect with your miner to your_ip:poolport


How to run multiple servers ?
This is an easy task.
Just make sure every server instance uses the same wallet passphrase in the code.
Copy the wallet.dat from the original server to the new server in the folder .primecoin.
Also copy the primecoin.conf file to the directory
Fire up the server and now you have two pools mining to the same wallet.
